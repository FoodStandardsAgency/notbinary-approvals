## What was the initial problem you were asked to look into?

**Context**

Approval of meat plant establishments at which controlled activities are carried out is a principal mechanism for the FSA to meet its statutory obligations as Competent Authority for food safety. The current process is built around isolated technologies and legacy ways of working. Business processes are highly manual and carry significant operational inefficiency and risk. 

Legislation is coming into force in September 2020 that will require government services to meet recognised accessibility standards. The Approvals application and tracking processes currently fall below the expected standard. 

**Size of problem**

Between 2016 and 2019, the FSA Approvals team has logged 169-197 approval applications each year from Food Business Operators (FBOs):

*   46% for additional activities
*   40% for new approvals
*   13% for  re-approvals

The majority of approvals requests are granted. Current application records do not support accurate or easy reporting on outcome volumes or durations. Approximately 10% are rejected by the FSA and ~2% are not taken forward by the FBO. Most applications that go through to Full Approval typically take 9 months to resolve. There are multiple touchpoints and interactions for each case, but these are unquantified, and existing ways of working do not enable easy tracking of interactions.

As well as application requests from FBOs, the team handle over 20 requests triggered by internal processes, such as audit outcomes, routine inspections, or third-party notice. 

Advisory visits have dropped from 3-8 to approximately 3-4 monthly (based on Finance invoicing) since these became chargeable in 2019.  

**Discovery question/hypothesis**

The discovery remit is to examine needs and opportunities for 

*   improving the flow and integration of approval application data
*   facilitating better tracking of applications
*   reducing manual overheads for managing the service
*   meeting internal and external user needs through the application process 

The discovery findings will support the design and development of prototypes for 

*   digitally enabling the approvals service
*   ensuring compliance with accessibility and official controls legislation.

### Team observations

**Was the initial question/hypothesis correct?**

It is evident that the current process for requesting and granting approval is not at all optimised. The current technology and operational setup has led to a fragmented and fractured service. Teams and tools are disconnected; processing and tracking is highly manual and in many parts avoidably complicated. Time pressures are exacerbated as a result of the inefficiencies, and arguably the true value of the service is lost chasing operational targets. 

**Possible gaps**

The current processes do not meet internal user needs. Historical surveys of FBO applicants indicate areas - such as visibility of progress and accuracy/timeliness of visit report confirmations - that they also fail to meet external needs. However, there have been adjustments to the approvals process and targets since those surveys, and it is unconfirmed as to what extent external needs are still unmet. 

**Reflections/recommendations**

The problem as presented is a discrete operational concern. In reality, approval application is often the first interaction that an FBO has with the FSA, and the start of a long cyclical relationship. There are immediate priorities to bring the current service up to an acceptable and accessible standard, but beyond this, the role of Approvals in establishing the ongoing relationship and triggering downstream processes and interactions with FBOs needs deeper consideration within the FSA. 

 


## Align stakeholders around the definition of the problem and recommendations

**_Demonstrate the team were able to engage the key stakeholders (internal and external, if appropriate) about the nature of the problem being explored and resulting recommendations at the end of the Discovery._**

**Team score**: **Met**~~/Partially met/Did not meet~~

### Team observations

**Something the team did well**

The team has used individual interviews and regular Show and Tells to ‘join the dots’ and improve alignment around the problem and recommendations. We have engaged widely with internal stakeholders, including those who do or could use the outputs or data generated through the approvals process, even where they are not directly involved in the Approvals process.  This has helped ensure greater strategic alignment to support Ops Transformation vision and to provide better context for the discovery recommendations, while surfacing connections between discrete but relevant initiatives that the FSA is carrying out.  

**Possible gaps**

Approval numbers are intrinsic to the Approvals process, the FSA’s subsequent interactions with FBOs and the wider traceability agenda. We recognise that approval number generation and allocation is a manually fraught process, but addressing this needs a broader industry and government conversation that is beyond the scope of this discovery. 

**Reflections/recommendations**

The FSA has an extensive portfolio of initiatives within and outside of the Ops Transformation programme. Many affect the FBO experience and their interactions with the agency. It will be increasingly important that there is alignment in how these are presented and delivered to ensure consistency of experience, both for external parties and the internal teams who may need to adapt to reimagined services. The FSA should consider how to position, develop and communicate a consistent experience across different processes it controls. 


## Identify all of the service users and their experience of the current service (where one exists). 

**_The team should have a good understanding of user needs, understand what users are trying to do when they engage with the current service._**

**Team score**: **Met**~~/Partially met/Did not meet~~

### Team observations

**Something the team did well**

The team quickly identified the key actors involved in processing and managing approval applications, and distinguished between primary creators and secondary re-users of approvals data. Different role holders in Approvals, Field Ops and Finance have been interviewed to understand how the process works or breaks for them and to understand pain points and opportunities. There had been limited opportunities to engage with time-pressured Field Veterinary Leads during Phase 1, so the team took advantage of the Quarterly FVL and Approvals meeting to support discovery research and gather feedback ensemble. 

**Possible gaps**

Getting access to FBOs with recent or current approval application experience has been problematic within the timeframe of the discovery.  An extended survey period was introduced going into Phase 2 to capture initial insights where possible to extend reach. Response rates were decent from a small pool, but volumes are not considered sufficient for evidencing or disproving need. 

Approvals Panel participants have not been specifically consulted. 

**Reflections/recommendations**

The current understanding of the service is heavily internally focussed. The FBO customer experience is incomplete, and more research is needed to understand the impact of current and proposed service touchpoints and interactions.  This is especially true and wholly necessary if the FSA intends to rebalance responsibilities in favour of FBOs. 


## Identify the key service challenges and opportunities for better meeting user needs

**_For example: what are the principle elements that need solving, what could improve the user experience, efficiencies, customer satisfaction improvements, cost-benefit to change_**

**Team score**: **Met**~~/Partially met/Did not meet~~

### Team observations

**Something the team did well**

A fundamental issue for the service is the manual gathering and re-entry of application data. Tackling a ‘lift and shift’ of the existing paper application during Phase 1 proved a valuable learning step to understanding the usability and interaction challenges that result from a paper-to-digital conversion. We were able to identify gaps and challenges that would need to be addressed by subsequent data and workflow models, as well as user interface proposals. This helped accelerate prototyping towards a coherent suite of assets in Phase 2, that also open up opportunities to better meet user needs. 

**Possible gaps**

The current approvals service is geared to monitor progress of approval requests from stage to stage within the official controls process, rather than the business, industry or food standards outcomes that are intended from legislation or policy.  Manual reporting based on the current approvals log is time-intensive and geared towards performance management. 

An improved data model enables the same type of reporting to be carried out more easily as well as creating opportunities for more progressive reporting. Alternative metrics have been identified that could demonstrate whether user needs are being met but these need to be fully considered against Ops Transformation goals and revised service delivery needs.  

**Reflections/recommendations**

The Approvals process itself is singular - it does not cater for different circumstances of FBO, such as large vs small abattoirs or seasonal operators, so is not effectively meeting different user needs.  Better segmentation at the approval stage is required to optimise the process for both the FSA and businesses. The lack of segmentation undermines the existing KPIs where operational deadlines can't be met, such as for seasonal plants. 

While Approvals volumes are nominally quite low, the complexity and length of resolving approval requests is non-trivial. An investment in modernising Approvals should not be seen as simply fixing Approvals - if approached as a service transformation rather than applying a technical patch, it could also reduce the burden on and yield benefits for downstream processes and services. 

The Approvals process is the starting point for a relationship between the FBO and FSA. It underpins the external engagement and internal activity that extends across the life of that establishment. Improving data capture and interactions with businesses at this stage can help streamline activity during and after approvals processing. It can create capacity within the experienced Approvals and Field Ops teams to handle complex interactions that especially need a human touch. 




## Identify key areas of focus for the next phase of work

**_For example: a part of the service that could cause particular pain or be difficult, or needs delving into in more depth to adequately understand. Indeed, whether further work is actually needed._**

**Team score**: **Met**~~/Partially met/Did not meet~~

### Team observations

**Something the team did well**

The team has looked to unpick the complications that have become ingrained in the service as a result of legacy constraints. It is clear that targeting improvement to some specific pivotal components and practices can have collateral benefits rather than getting stuck trying to change the whole process in one go. The following principles inform our strategy for the next discovery phase: 

*   improve initial data capture to eliminate a significant amount of manual entry and re-keying. 
*   improve data flow to substantially reduce manual reporting and tracking effort. 

In the second phase, the team has continued to critically deconstruct and rebuild a view of approvals service in the data, workflow and design models that have been prototyped. These artefacts have been essential conversation pieces to build better shared understanding of the problem and opportunity space, both across the team and with key users and stakeholders. 

**Possible gaps**

Case management is a well-solved problem, and there are likely off-the-shelf products that meet many of the FSA requirements. The same holds true for workflow systems that could serve as the ‘engine under the hood’ of an integrated suite. No significant product or market analysis has been done in this discovery. No cost-benefit analysis of the FSA’s capacity or capability to implement and maintain recommendations has been carried out as part of this discovery, but the assets provided by the discovery can be used by the FSA to support such an assessment. 

**Reflections/recommendations**

Accessibility is a priority concern for any technical solution. If adopting third party tools, suppliers need to be tasked to deliver clear commitments around their accessibility roadmap to ensure that the FSA can meet its legislative obligations.  It is possible (and arguably desirable) to decouple system components (data, workflow and user interface) and de-risk investment by leveraging intelligent off-the-shelf workflow tools, but commissioning a bespoke and fully accessible user interface. 

The data and workflow models provided can be used to prototype and compare solutions in third party automation tools.  The application and case management prototypes developed during discovery should be elaborated and tested with users.

There is an additional legal obligation for the FSA to publish approvals related data. The data model proposed helps facilitate this without convoluting business processes. 

The service vision is towards a self-serve gateway for FBOs that encompasses approvals and other in-life transactions and assets (including invoices, audit reports and other formal correspondence).  The next steps backlog presented provides a suggested route to achieving this. The workflows provided can be used to review, redefine and/or redesign the core business processes, as part of Ops Transformation and other projects, including raising questions about why tasks are performed and how they could be improved and/or entirely reimagined to achieve the future operating model. 


## Demonstrate how the team has worked together using agile methods and the learning from this

**_How did you work together, in particular, how you engaged the business and stakeholders. How have you adapted as you learned more._**

**Team score**: **Met**~~/Partially met/Did not meet~~

### Team observations

**Something the team did well**

The team continues to use standups, sprint planning, retrospectives and show and tells to focus each sprint and share insight. Roadmapping the discovery early has helped to scaffold the delivery plan and identify potential research pinch points and opportunities to take preemptive action, such as survey planning and digital conversion of the application form. 

Interview followup sessions and weekly research roundups have been used to quickly build shared understanding within the team. While this hasn’t allowed for full synthesis and analysis in the compressed first research phase, it has enabled the team to quickly determine prototyping priorities. This shared understanding has proved invaluable during the second phase, and the team have aligned superbly around clear discovery goals. 

**Possible gaps**

The existing team has incorporated new team members well including a new FSA Product Owner who has supported the team well. However, adapting working patterns for the circumstances of the pandemic have made it harder to directly involve the project’s Digital Liaison. Despite regular catchup sessions scheduled between the Delivery Manager and Digital Liaison to mitigate, regular feedback and insight from Digital has been missed - both to keep aligned to the broader digital strategy and portfolio, and to actively share our methods and processes for the FSA’s learning. 

**Reflections/recommendations**

Access to external stakeholders continues to take significant effort to coordinate. Uncertainty about their availability is not wholly compatible with the timeboxed structure of the discovery. In future, if external users are not proactively engaged before the discovery, it may be more expedient to cut straight to asynchronous research methods such as surveys, and use those to invite followup interviews. 

Prototyping has proved a valuable phase of the discovery for users and stakeholders, but particularly also for aligning the team with a shared vision across workstreams. This had begun before the research phase was completed, which was vital to approach Phase 2 with a clearer concept and focus. While workstreams have worked hard to remain aligned throughout with regular internal demos and iteration, a further week at the end would have been beneficial to re-incorporate user feedback and advanced analysis across prototypes and other workstream assets.
