## User segments

The user segments identified for targeted research in this discovery cover the roles and/or teams involved in the Approvals service. 

Primary user roles are those that are directly involved as either as _subject_, _owner_ or _contributor_. 

Research [observations](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-approvals/wiki/Approvals-research-findings)from Primary user group interviews are synthesised into Personas. [Personas](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-approvals/wiki/personas)for priority user segments are further elaborated with [user needs](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-approvals/wiki/user-needs). 

Secondary user roles encompass occasional supporting casts or adjacent actors who are important to consider alongside the core user groups. However, some secondary users group roles were considered significant enough to also synthesised into Persona and also elaborated with [user needs](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-approvals/wiki/user-needs).

Approvals data is created by FBO during the Approvals application process. 

The Approvals data is processed and checked for completeness by the Approvals Support Officer. All data goes through the Approvals Support Officer. 

Finance will verify application information.

Approvals Coordinator and Leads will interrogate the FBO data.

Once the application is considered 'complete' the Field Veterinary Leader (FVL) who covers the area in which the FBO wants to operate will arrange a visit. 

The FVL will access the Approvals application data before arranging a suitable time for an inspection visit. 

The FVC will access the Approvals application data before arranging a suitable time for an inspection visit.
