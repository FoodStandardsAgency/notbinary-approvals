## Kudos

- Stephen for comprehensive service walkthrough
- Stephen for good job on the blueprint work and presentation!
- Stephen for his comprehensive service blueprint walkthrough. Well received by all attendees.
- To the people who were on the blueprint review. Broad mix of interests and role to play in the approval process.
- Jonno for the interactive case management prototypes. Really shows where this could all go next.
- Jonno for extended progress on interactive prototypes
- Jag for putting together the Service Self Assessment
- Jag for extremely concise and well written documentation for self assessment & for show and tells
- Jag for a good summary of a lot of work in the service assessment.
- Paul McG for insights and review of recommendations backlog
- Miro...one more time, it's been doing the job!
- Data team for their feedback.
- Jamie for tech writeup, which has built up nicely and openly - looking solid and coherent, and aligns well with the rest of the disco workstreams. Really good job since joining the team partway through.
- Team for contributions to the service assessment: stronger product as a result.

## Went well


- Adobe XD for clickable prototyping - easy to work with, update and share for feedback.
- Feedback from Penny etc. seemed positive, also some good pointers for the final work
- Review of UI and data approach with Data team provided useful validation and feedback, and is helpful for both teams during and beyond the discovery.
- Feel there's good alignment between the workstreams in piecing together the design and mapping needed to modernise approvals.
- Nice seeing just how much we've covered across the workstreams in the user needs doc the other day
- Having quick updates and walkthroughs on workstreams to keep things in line.
- Blueprint walkthrough was excellent
- In a good place timing-wise for service assessment and final show and tell assets.


## To improve

- Another FBO interview bites the dust.
- Tricky as a developer determining how to produce sensible output in a disco
- Probably would have added more perspective having Dan and Henrieta on the blueprint walkthrough but couldn't be helped with the scheduling this week.
- Headline recommendations are especially gnarly for this disco. They make sense in their own right, but the narrative is hard = maybe a little easier when you look at it from outside approvals.
- Timing on the final straight

## Action items

- [ ] Balancing interdependencies between workstreams, so that outputs support each other towards the discovery goals.
- [ ] Set the expectation of scope probing vs scope creep
