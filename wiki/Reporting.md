# Reporting Notes

# Two key types of report:
* HOD Report (Head of Delivery)
* Two weekly Approvals Team to FVL Report

Both are time consuming to create

## HOD Report
Purpose of HUD Report is to feed back to the heads of deliveries how the FVLs are using their time, and where they are not meeting specific KPIs e.g. “A particular FVL is taking longer than others”.

This is a particularly time consuming report to generate.

_Note: Groups of FVLs report to a Head of Delivery.  There are three heads of deliveries covering the geographical areas of England and Wales_

There are certain time constraints that are applied to the FVL and the Approvals team as a whole.

_Note: These events are important to consider in the context of how equivalent reports could be generated_

* (FVL KPI) Time between an application arriving and them contacting the FBO
* (FVL KPI) Time it takes from an approval visit to their submission of report to the approvals team (Recommendation submitted outside of 5 days)
* (Approvals KPI) Within 5 days of receiving report to approvals team and getting report back to FBO)
* (FVL KPI) Receipt of application - FVL will contact the FBO within 10 working days
* There are no time restrictions between first contact of FVL to an FBO and the date of first visit, as this is a mutually agreed upon time between both parties
* (FVL KPI) 3 Month and 6 month deadlines are from the date of conditional approval granted.  The FVL visits again, assuming conditional approval has been granted the previous time

_Note
3CE exports are out of scope for this piece of work - handled by a different part of the approvals team, not involving FVLs_

All of this data can be collected from the approvals log spreadsheet

## Two Weekly FVL Reports
Every two weeks each member of the approvals team sends an update to each of their FVLs (3 FVLs).

This is essentially filtering out approvals log to show
* Which deadlines are approaching for that individual FVL for the deadlines mentioned above
* Whether the approval process is currently waiting on some form of input from an FVL

_Note
The FVLs use Outlook Calendar, which may provide some potential options for advanced automation of this process_
