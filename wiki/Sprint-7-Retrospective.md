## Went well


- Seems we are all in a very good place for the final week. 
- Another successful show & tell
- Feedback from Show and Tell participants continues to be positive, even after the Show & Telll has finished.
- "very much what I was hoping for .. very pleasing"
- Jonno's approvals team application flow and CMS walk-through
- FBO interview, good questions and engagement
- Being able to show some visuals to an FBO during interview
- Jamie's walkthrough of the APIs. Really helpful to see what is needed under the hood to make any of this work!
- Really good coherence across all the strands. There's a consistent picture building, which makes it easier to describe what needs to be done, why and how.
- All teams involved seem to have the right expectations of the final handover.
- Having a relatively meeting-free week and being able to focus.
- Conversations around status management have been very useful


## To improve

- FBOs turning up to agreed interviews

## Action items

- Prototypes have value for discovery team members as well as users.
