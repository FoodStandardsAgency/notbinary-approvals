## What was the initial problem you were asked to look into?

**Context**

Approval of meat plant establishments at which controlled activities are carried out is a principal mechanism for the FSA to meet its statutory obligations as Competent Authority for food safety.  The current process is built around isolated technologies and legacy ways of working. Business processes are highly manual and carry significant operational inefficiency and risk. 

Legislation is coming into force in September 2020 that will require government services to meet recognised accessibility standards. The Approvals application and tracking processes currently fall below the expected standard. 

**Size of problem**

Between 2016 and 2019, the FSA Approvals team has logged 169-197 approval applications each year from Food Business Operators (FBOs):

*   46% for additional activities
*   40% for new approvals
*   13% for  re-approvals

Most applications that go through to Full Approval typically take 9 months to resolve. 

Advisory visits have dropped from 3-8 to approximately 3-4 monthly (based on Finance invoicing) since these became chargeable in 2019. 

**Discovery question/hypothesis**

The discovery remit is to examine needs and opportunities for 

*   improving the flow and integration of approval application data
*   facilitating better tracking of applications
*   reducing manual overheads for managing the service
*   meeting internal and external user needs through the application process 

The discovery findings will support the design and development of prototypes for 

*   digitally enabling the approvals service
*   ensuring compliance with accessibility and official controls legislation.

### Team observations

**Was the initial question/hypothesis correct?**

It is evident that the current process for requesting and granting approval is not at all optimised. The current technology and operational setup has led to a fragmented and fractured service. Teams and tools are disconnected; processing and tracking is highly manual and in many parts avoidably complicated. Time pressures are exacerbated as a result of the inefficiencies, and arguably the true value of the service is lost chasing operational targets. 

**Possible gaps**

The current processes do not meet internal user needs. Historical surveys of FBO applicants indicate areas - such as visibility of progress and accuracy/timeliness of visit report confirmations - that they fail to meet external needs. However, there have been adjustments to the approvals process and targets since those surveys, and it is unconfirmed as to what extent external needs are still unmet. 

**Reflections/recommendations**

The problem as presented is a discrete operational concern. In reality, approval application is often the first interaction that an FBO has with the FSA, and the start of a long cyclical relationship.  There are immediate priorities to bring the current service up to an acceptable and accessible standard, but beyond this, the role of Approvals in establishing the ongoing relationship and triggering downstream processes and interactions with FBOs needs deeper consideration within the FSA.

 


## Align stakeholders around the definition of the problem and recommendations

**_Demonstrate the team were able to engage the key stakeholders (internal and external, if appropriate) about the nature of the problem being explored and resulting recommendations at the end of the Discovery._**

**Team score**: Met/Partially met/Did not meet

### Team observations

**Something the team did well**

The team has used individual interviews and regular Show and Tells to ‘join the dots’ and improve alignment around the problem and recommendations. We have engaged widely with internal stakeholders, including those who do or could use the outputs or data generated through the approvals process, even where they are not directly involved in the Approvals process.  This has helped ensure greater strategic alignment to support Ops Transformation vision and to provide better context for the discovery recommendations, while surfacing connections between discrete but relevant initiatives that the FSA is carrying out.  

**Possible gaps**

Approval numbers are intrinsic to the Approvals process, the FSA’s subsequent interactions with FBOs and the wider traceability agenda. We recognise that approval number generation and allocation is a manually fraught process, but addressing this needs a broader industry and government conversation that is beyond the scope of this discovery. 

**Reflections/recommendations**

The FSA has an extensive portfolio of initiatives within and outside of the Ops Transformation programme. Many affect the FBO experience and their interactions with the agency. It will be increasingly important that there is alignment in how these are presented and delivered to ensure consistency of experience, both for external parties and the internal teams who may need to adapt to reimagined services. The FSA should consider how to position, develop and communicate a consistent experience across different processes it controls. 


## Identify all of the service users and their experience of the current service (where one exists). 

**_The team should have a good understanding of user needs, understand what users are trying to do when they engage with the current service._**

**Team score**: Met/Partially met/Did not meet

### Team observations

**Something the team did well**

The team quickly identified the key actors involved in processing and managing approval applications, and distinguished between primary creators and secondary re-users of approvals data. Different role holders in Approvals, Field Ops and Finance have been interviewed to understand how the process works or breaks for them and to understand pain points and opportunities. 

**Possible gaps**

Getting access to FBOs with recent or current approval application experience has been problematic within the timeframe of the discovery.  An extended survey period has been introduced to capture initial insights where possible to extend reach. 

There have been limited opportunities to engage with time-pressured Field Veterinary Leads. Approvals Panel participants have not been specifically consulted. 

**Reflections/recommendations**

The current understanding of the service is heavily internally focussed. The FBO customer experience is largely missing, and more research is needed to understand the impact of current and proposed service touchpoints and interactions.  


## Identify the key service challenges and opportunities for better meeting user needs

**_For example: what are the principle elements that need solving, what could improve the user experience, efficiencies, customer satisfaction improvements, cost-benefit to change_**

**Team score**: Met/Partially met/Did not meet

### Team observations

**Something the team did well**

A fundamental issue for the service is the manual gathering and re-entry of application data. This underpins the reliability and efficient reuse of data for workflow management and application tracking / reporting.  The team has moved swiftly to explore how the existing application form can be digitally and accessibly enabled to improve data capture using the GDS prototyping kit, and to start understanding the usability and interaction challenges that result from a paper-to-digital conversion.  

**Possible gaps**

The ‘lift and shift’ is currently restricted to the more complex new approvals application form. While this has yielded some learnings about the design and information architecture of the form we have not had access to FBOs to do any further validation up to this point, or to underpin or test service design consequences of a paper-to-digital conversion. 

**Reflections/recommendations**

Migrating from paper to digital form has to be underpinned by a user-driven service design approach. While evolving the online application form opens up the opportunity for automated data capture and re-use, more needs to be done to understand the question model and application flow that FBOs are exposed to, as well as how the application data model can support subsequent application management processes and tracking. 




## Identify key areas of focus for the next phase of work

**_For example: a part of the service that could cause particular pain or be difficult, or needs delving into in more depth to adequately understand. Indeed, whether further work is actually needed._**

**Team score**: Met/Partially met/Did not meet

### Team observations

**Something the team did well**

The team has looked to unpick the complications that have become ingrained in the service as a result of legacy constraints. It is clear that targeting improvement to some specific pivotal components and practices can have collateral benefits rather than getting stuck trying to change the whole process in one go. The following principles inform our strategy for the next discovery phase: 

*   improve initial data capture to eliminate a significant amount of manual entry and re-keying. 
*   improve data flow to substantially reduce manual reporting and tracking effort. 

**Possible gaps**

No cost-benefit analysis or assessment of the FSA’s capacity or capability to implement and maintain recommendations has been carried out as part of this discovery. It is clear that case management is a well-solved problem, and there are likely off-the-shelf products that meet many of the FSA requirements. No product or market analysis is to be done in this discovery. 

**Reflections/recommendations**

*   Evolve the prototype application form to adopt a question flow that is consistent with other government services (such as Register a Food Business) and data model that is consistent with FSA standards. 
*   Improving the initial caseload view of the application tracking system and modelling an appropriate workflow, including identifying key triggers and actions.  
*   As we learn more about the data structure, we will seek to devise mock data interfaces that can be used to test data transfer from and into the approvals service. 


## Demonstrate how the team has worked together using agile methods and the learning from this

**_How did you work together, in particular, how you engaged the business and stakeholders. How have you adapted as you learned more._**

**Team score**: Met/Partially met/Did not meet

### Team observations

**Something the team did well**

The team continues to use standups, sprint planning, retrospectives and show and tells to focus each sprint and share insight. Roadmapping the discovery early and ringfencing research weeks has helped to scaffold the delivery plan. Interview followup sessions and weekly research roundups have been used to quickly build shared understanding. While this hasn’t allowed for full synthesis and analysis in the compressed first research phase, it has enabled the team to quickly determine prototyping priorities for the second phase of the discovery. 

**Possible gaps**

The existing team has incorporated new team members well including a new FSA Product Owner. However, working patterns have made it harder to directly involve the project’s Digital Liaison. Regular catchup sessions are scheduled between the Delivery Manager and Digital Liaison to mitigate. 

**Reflections/recommendations**

Access to external stakeholders continues to take significant effort to coordinate. Uncertainty about their availability is not wholly compatible with the timeboxed structure of the discovery. In future, if external users are not proactively engaged before the discovery, it may be more expedient to cut straight to asynchronous research methods such as surveys, and use those to invite followup interviews.
