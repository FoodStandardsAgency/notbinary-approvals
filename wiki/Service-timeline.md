## Service Timeline vs Approvals Lifecycle
An approval is a living record; it must be maintained so it is current and accurately reflects the activities the FBO wishes to carry out. There is a burden of responsibility on both the FBO to provide current and accurate information about their operations, and on the FSA to grant and report approval for regulated activities.

This means there is not a straightforward, linear timeline to describe the approvals process. Instead, there is an ongoing and cyclical sequence of work that continues for as long as the FBO needs to be approved by the FSA.

We have also shown that approvals depend on a number of stakeholders working collaboratively, providing information or effort at different points in time. These are not one-way relationships - the approvals process captures information that is leveraged downstream:
* In Field Operations to create Statements of Resource and implement a right-sized inspection effort at each food business.
* In the Audit team to initiate the audit cycle that ensures compliance is being maintained at an appropriate level.
* In the Finance team to ensure FBOs are charged the accurately for inspection services delivered as part of the official controls.


### Approvals Lifecycle
The **Approvals Lifecycle** maps the end-to-end journey of an approval. It depicts the activities that enable a meat plant operator to operate and the FSA to regulate in line with the Official Controls they are required to deliver as the Competent Authority.

The Approvals Lifecycle is dependent on the audit cycle. The continuation of an approval is dependent on the outcomes from audit visits which can determine when an approval is reviewed and potentially suspended or withdrawn.

Within the lifecycle there are a number of task-specific deadlines which help to schedule and coordinate the process. Only at the point an FBO is granted conditional approval does a final deadline of six months to complete full approval come into play.

The Approvals Lifecycle shows this as a series of workflows, with each workflow made up of a sequence of triggers, actions and tasks.

### Workflows
The Approvals Lifecycle comprises a number of workflows - strings of processes and tasks that underpin the request and fulfilment activities. Some workflows are self-contained while others are dependent on other actions taking place.

The following workflows have been created as part of this discovery. These workflows cover the interactions and tasks from an FBO making an initial enquiry about approvals; through application; operating with an approval; and ending FSA approval.

Each workflow is constrained by governance (legislative and organisational policy), processes and procedures, and resources (people and technology). These are addressed in the [Service Blueprint](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-approvals/wiki/service-blueprint).

By breaking the service timeline into workflows, we can address specific bottlenecks, break points, user needs, and other issues while still being able to reassemble the workflow strings into an overarching service. 

Workflows can be used to guide service design, product design and development. Further elaboration is likely to expand on the flow logic and to incorporate specific business rules. They may also help to work out permissions and access to systems and information.
