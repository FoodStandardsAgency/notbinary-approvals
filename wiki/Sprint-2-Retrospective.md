## Kudos

- Richard Withers for confirming and clarifying the legislative picture.
- Paul Murray for leading on user interviews and keeping them moving forward. Feels like you adapted them to incorporate more and more questions as the week went on but managed to keep the timings on point as well as the results!
- Jane Clark and Enrique Vega for their insights from a vet policy perspective and providing additional context.
- Stephen for very comprehensive and articulate explanation of findings.
- Hannah Barker for Ops Transformation context and updates
- Hannah Barker for bringing us up to date on the Ops Transformation work and confirming we're thinking along the right lines. 
- Paul McGuinness for recognising / keeping scope focus
- Richard Collier for giving a lot more context around the finance touchpoints and potential pinch points.

## Went well


- Internal stakeholder/approvals team interviews
- Post-interview "hot takes" are still helpful, and have helped identify followup lines of enquiry for subsequent interviews.
- EOW research review seemed to be additive rather than duplicating hot takes sessions.
- Session flows are going well = good time handling
- Amount of interviews and timing between (plus post sessions) worked well.
- Interview follow up works well
- Wider stakeholder conversations have helped provide a lot of context and things to help frame what we're doing, without distracting from the scope.
- Schedule this week has seemed intense but manageable
- User interviews have been well structured and paced, and the interviewees have all been engaged and provided good insight.
- Wider stakeholder interviews help surface hidden interests and break down silos
- Good feedback from Ops Transformation about the project communications


## To improve

- Need more FBO UR interviews
- Reports of some people trying to get into Show & Tell - repeating calendar invites lingering. ðŸ˜£
- Recording playback was a bit choppy for the Jane & Enrique call. Audio was popping quite a lot.
- Not so much to improve, but to be aware of ... the stakeholder sessions are unravelling some important leads to followups, Need to balance carefully.
