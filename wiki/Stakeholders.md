## Service stakeholders 

The service stakeholders identified for this discovery cover the roles and/or teams involved in delivering the Approvals Lifecycle. 

The principal stakeholder groups identified for targeted research in this discovery are described in the [User Segments](User-segments) section.

**Customer base**
* **169-197 x FBOs** submitting applications for approvals per year between 2016-19.
* **All approved establishments in the UK** (all of which must be entered in the Approved Premises Management System managed by the FSA and published on the food.gov website, regardless of who the competent authority is).

**Fulfilment**

Ownership of the approvals process rests within Regulatory Delivery and Operational Transformation (RDOT). In practice, approvals are delivered by a blended team of approvals administrators and field veterinary staff from RDOT and Field Operations.

* **6 x Approvals Team administrators** (RDOT)
* **9 x Field Veterinary Leads** (Field Ops)
* **18 x Field Veterinary Coordinators** (Field Ops)

**Note.** Field Ops staff are not dedicated to approvals work and have other responsibilities to deliver inspections which may take precedence.

It brings together senior civil service (the Single Authorised Officer), legal, veterinary and approvals team expertise to review FVL recommendations and advise on more complex or contentious decisions. The terms of reference for the panel lists its core membership as:
