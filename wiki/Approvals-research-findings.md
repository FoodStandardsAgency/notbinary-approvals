# User interviews 

User fall into three broad groups, FSA office staff (Approvals team, finance), Field staff (FVL, FVCs) and Food Business Operators (FBO). These are the 'hot takes' from each group. 

## FSA interviews 

**Approvals and Registrations Lead (FSA)**

* Intelligence sharing is important
* Relationship between field ops and Approvals is important
* Follow up on getting their own field ops vets 
* We take the role of “Am I ready to apply”
* Standard approval ID for registers
* Internal process needs to be improved 
* We track time from inspection to issue 
* Disconnect between audits and approvals 
* Consider data standards - look into how can be adopted by LA
* Conditional logic would be useful for streamlined inspection forms for FVLs
* Segmentation 
* Notification improvements would help FBOs
* **Most important fix** Need a single source of truth

**Approvals and Registrations Coordinator (FSA)**

* Manual provisioning of numbers - this should be automatic 
* Audit trail would be useful - not making this association or no perceived benefit for transferring between competent authorities 
* Reporting changes every month, no narrative or consistent measurable numbers
* Self-organising FVLs
* Updating letter templates every few months seems like a lot (vets make recommendations as well as policy) 
* Change process for templates could be more robust - no version control (who is sign-off) 
* **Most important fix** - approvals log and template generator

**Approvals and Registration Support Officers (FSA)**

* Approval numbers change seems arbitrary - build-up of legacy ways of working 
* Confusion about authorisation and approved activities
* Recognise a lot of reliance on Audit and Field Ops 
* Lots of manually trawling through reports and spreadsheets to check status and take / prompt action
* Fortnightly FVL report - not complex, really easy win
* Who made the spreadsheet?!
* Calendars and shared mailbox - arbitrary, discretionary and disconnected ways of managing workload / workflow
* “continuity of operation” 
* “Checking the paperwork” - what can be done upfront in the application process to make this easier for Approvals and/or FBOs?
* Approval number allocation is brittle and risky, with potential costly consequences
* Audit outcomes are invisible to Approvals
* Manual admin overload
* Chasing up and monitoring timeliness is important
* Not as critical of the process, work around it 
* Uses checklists and mailbox tagging to manage workload
* Admin complexity
* SQL server audit report - to chase 
* Got sense that they didn’t want to promote advisory visits 
* Processes are still siloed, not thinking about traceability
* Opportunity to speak to FVLs at quarterly meeting 
* Not a fan of E&P
* Has very little interaction with LA
* **Most important fix** the Approvals log

**FVL one**

* FVC need same information as FVLs for unannounced visits
* FBO could view process as a cast of thousands all with their own systems
* Only 10% only make it to full approval on the second visit. Most take the full 6 months to get approval
* Seasonal approval could result in multi season long pre-approval
* Can FBO refuse mobile devices - they should be able to for official controls
* FVL report from approvals team seems like a work for not much value to the FVLs
* FVL photographic evidence report requires a convoluted process of sending single pictures to your own mailbox - can be upto 100 pictures
* FVLs send letter to LA following an advisory visit
* **Most important fix** - Forms, and specifically the report

**FVL two**

* Roles (End-to-end Approvals, Portfolio Lead, Animal By Products, Official Controls)
* FVC inter-approval visit is done at the discretion of the FVL 
* FBO tells you they are ready, but they are not, eg, structure is not 
* FBO can be hard to contact - not responsive - not office-based: AO chases on request and behalf
* Monthly report or fortnightly report? 
* Jose only takes pictures and then writes up a report the next day. No other note taking is used - requires good short term memory
* Photo transfer is time consuming
* Visit Kit: Phone, computer, light meter app on phone, thermometer probe
* Confirms visit with email to FBO even though arranged via phone call (quicker) 
* **Most important fix** Fix and improve the photo report

## FBO

**FBO one**
* Found the advisory visit valuable 
* Found FSA approval and use of logo good for business - gives their customers confidence
* FSA is seen as having value and has a good reputation
* Was well prepared for the application
* Went for approval even though he was possibly exempt
* Fragmented exposure to different ‘govt people’
* Thinks all FBO should be approved by the FSA
* Most challenging part was physical space and building changes after FVL visit
* Preferred email over login portal approach
* Better links between the application form and the relevant parts of the MIG
* Felt that not having an advisory visit made the application easier

**FBO two**

* FSA approval perceived as a badge of honour
  * questioning whether the pain of the approval process is worth it
  * but is there really a choice between going for LA and FSA approval? 
* Segmentation: 
  * seek appropriate approval based on size of operator
  * “biased against small producers”
* Contrast between Environmental Health / LA and FSA process (1 v 4 visits, afternoon vs 12 months)
* Total cost of seeking approval - thousands
* Complexity of application process - needed a consultant
  * paperwork
* Poor attitude from FSA officers involved in approvals and audit
  * mentality is to punish and prosecute, not help or guide
* Audit schedule clash with approvals process
* Field Ops AM and OV 
  * good relationship with day-to-day
  * provide connection to approvals process
* Very low digital literacy
  * fully digital service is not sufficient
* Visit reports and instructions are clear

**FBO three**

* Date/Time to start operating should be on the application form 
* Difference of approach between large and small business from the FSA
* Language of the guidance - FSA guidance is thorough, but not always user friendly
* Types of establishment was not clear 
* Vocal about wanting to be part of small abattoir community 
* Wants branding for competitive advantage 
* Likes being able to call the Approvals team
* Can see the value in a portal 
* Application form was a stumbling block - needed support and help in understanding what he needs to write 
* Relationships are important to them. They feel like they are getting into a relationship with FSA
