## 12 August 2020

## Actions

- FSA/NB: Include an extra 'protected' time in the schedule to do write-ups and assessment ... +3 days is useful.
- FSA/NB: Incorporate prototyping as part of the discovery schedule to go along with user and background research.
- NB: Consider options to handover rich assets (such as in Miro) to the client, beyond just an image or PDF

## Kudos

* Jamie for getting up to speed quickly from partway through the disco and turning out robust thinking and assets.
* Stephen for comprehensive and coherent workflow and service design analysis and outputs.
* Jonno for range and depth of prototype development - super tangible outputs to have the design conversation around.
* Paul Murray for patiently wrangling a tricky user research gig and kicking the story map into shape.
* Paul McGuinness for stepping up to the PO role and supporting the team throughout.
* All for good work on the final presentation and presentations throughout
* Jag for pulling everything together for the final week, and to baby Jag for holding off their arrival until it was all over.
* The whole team for covering my (Paul Murray) leave days during the disco
* Great prototype work from Jonno, hopefully will inform how they will think about both applications and case management solutions more than just throwing more forms at it + showing the benefits of having everything in one place
* To the team for asking questions and sharing ideas throughout. Definitely helped produce some coordinated output, especially given we have been remote the whole time.
* Paul McGuinness, thanks for all the information over the last few weeks on all the systems and data - made a complex set of processes really easy to understand
* The team, felt the final show and tell fit together really well, consistent narrative
* Jag, the set-up and operating information around the S&T - how we work etc, is good.
* The whole team. Worked well together throughout discovery.
* Jonno for producing prototypes that set a high bar for whatever/whoever follows. Really good to have the visuals when mapping workflows and service design aspects.
* Paul McG and the approvals team for keeping engaged and providing constructive feedback throughout.
* Stephen, the service work ties everything together particularly visible during the Q&A session.
* Service Assessment Panel for some really good questions to test the robustness of our work and shared understanding
* Jamie for coming onboard half way through and producing some very detailed work from scratch.
* Paul Murray for extracting a lot of user material and analysis out of a challenging lack of users!

## Went well

- Stephen: Prototyping as part of discovery is a good way to provide focus for the workstreams.
- Prototyping is a useful mechanism to align the internal team.
- Technical scope of disco (with both research and prototyping) is effective.
- All work streams lined up well - good communication and open working throughout
- Service Assessment presentation and panel was crisp and insightful.
- Great turnout for final show and tell.
- Having the extra three days for wrap up and final S&T/assessment was much better than cramming it in the last week of discovery.
- 3 days at the end to tie everything together was useful.
- Tools of the trade, Miro, Adobe and Swagger all worked well.
- Good amount of time for the whole thing, felt there was plenty of time to fine tune the outputs
- Feels like there's been more on wiki earlier. Documenting on the go is good, but easily slips.
- The quality of outputs and assets to handover is superb again. Really good depth.
- Remote working and the tool choices have worked well. Some face to face would have been helpful at times but it wasn't essential.
- Perhaps more internal stakeholder reviews this time round (beyond service blueprint) - has been good to get feedback from the teams (such as Data) who will be party to delivering this beyond the discovery.
- Overall pace and structure of the disco.
- All presentations have been thorough and clear, with all workstreams joining up well.
- All show & tells well attended with positive responses and engagement
- Tackling the lift and shift even before all the user research was complete is useful to shake out implicit needs that are locked into pre-existing tools.
- Regular WIP updates to show and tell internally - good for feedback, alignment and iteration.
- Show and Tell weekly narratives have been used really well.
- Video the interviews as a reusable research asset
- Feels like the process and working is very much figured out for us as a team after this Discovery (and the previous 11 months!)

## To improve

- Always schedule 75 minutes for the final show and tell.
- Access to users - FBOs in this case
- External user engagement starts too late.
- Lack of FBO engagement isn't a barrier to modernising Approvals - not sure that came through.
- The idea that discovery is problem exploration not solution development - still not landing in some places.
- A couple of data analysis gaps seemed to come up in the panel - not critical, but good to take note of
- Not enough time for the final S&T and Service Assessment. An extra 15 minutes each would help.
- FSA Digital engagement has been low - missed opportunity to absorb methods.
- Some misalignment of expectations within Digital was slightly derailing midway through.
- I think people sometimes expect this sort of thing to produce a waterfall style specification for a system
- Had to ringfence areas to explore further but which might have added value.
- Absence of SRO. Delegates responded and engaged well but a shame to not have full sponsor involvement. Not clear that there is a good route to champion this going forward.
- Some of the chat channel on S&T is a distraction.
