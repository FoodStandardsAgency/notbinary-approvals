## Future service metrics
Production reporting is currently a fully manual, labour-intensive task. There is not consistency in the information being demanded, and therefore created. The current Approvals Log simply does not enable effective reporting of service metrics. The frequent use of free text means any measurement must be interpreted from information rather than extrapolated from data.

A future approvals service would enable more typical, and standardised, service management reporting. These should be implemented to support continuous improvement as a critical part of ensuring the service remains fit for purpose. Continuous improvement means having an ongoing approach to monitoring and measuring all the elements that make up a service and refining them as situations and business needs change.

### Approval status
Ascertaining the current status of an approval or its position in the approvals lifecycle is dependent on the information captured in the Approvals Log. Much of this information is text-based. Where codes have been used, different status codes are used between the Log and other FSA systems such as E&P. This discovery found no real consistency between status codes in any of the systems we explored. A number of legacy codes also remain in all systems but have not necessarily been de-activated and may have been used for different purposes at different times. Current status codes and reporting make it challenging to track and trace individual approvals or to identify trends.

Defining codes based on the status of an approval, the action in the lifecycle, and the future, current or past state of that action, and then aligning these codes with other data repositories would help measure the productivity of the service.

### Productivity
Current reports include production statistics such as numbers of applications, advisory visits, and assessments, as well as the number of times reporting or approval completion deadlines have been missed. All of this data is collated manually by FVCs.

A future approvals service would enable a deeper level of granularity in the data being captured, such as identifying different types of FBO and type of request/application, and timestamping of actions. This level of data would enable improved service monitoring and allow for greater segmentation in the way approvals are delivered and supported. This would enable reporting on approval types outside the scope of this discovery, such as approvals for third party export.

With this level of data mapped and exposed, designing reports using existing tools such as PowerBI would be enabled, and/or reporting could be scheduled and auto-generated.

### Workload planning
Demand on FVL time is constrained and difficult to manage, particularly as a lack of centralised information makes it difficult to predict or monitor workload trends. By adopting a request and service management approach, and defining workflows with trackable, timestamped tasks it would become easier to spot pinch points in the process and highlight resource clashes. There is a value in collaborating over shared expert resource, and a risk of creating 'super silos' by simply assigning duplicate resources to teams, when the problems might be resolved with improved workforce management data.


### 'Average time to operate' and 'Total time to operate'
It is not currently easy to report on the time it takes an FBO to achieve either conditional or full approval.
A six month to completion deadline is currently in place from the time an FBO is granted conditional approval. However, there is a considerable amount of application assessment work across multiple teams before conditional approval can be granted.

The approval process requires a staged progression towards full approval meaning there will always be a limit to how much the time it takes for an FBO to reach approved operations. However, consistent data would allow the Approvals Team to spot trends, identify common roadblocks or pinch points, and differentiate issues that may depend on the size or scale of the FBO. A time to operate report would assist with segmentation initiatives and allow for realistic performance indicators.
