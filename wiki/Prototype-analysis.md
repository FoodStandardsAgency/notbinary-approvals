## Prototype Analysis

### Using prototype scorecards

In the Prototyping Phase, we are exploring ideas for improving the Approvals service. 

Having investigated the end-to-end Approvals process and identified key areas that could be addressed in the short and medium-term, we are now taking a more detailed look into ways to improve how Approvals works and information is collected. 

The prototype Scorecard is used to compare our new concepts with the way user needs are currently being delivered. The Scorecard is organised by user type and their approvals activities. 

### Approvals Scorecard

The [Approvals Scorecard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pNrzi7R8Y-i-LZKTSJ6BUGubo0PeD_WY8QqXtp2Vgjk/edit#gid=0) shows the current system against the Data Model, the Workflow, the Case Management Prototype and the Application Prototype against the different user needs: 

* As a Approvals and registration Coordinator/Lead
* As a Approvals and registration Support Officer
* As a Finance team member
* As a Field Veterinary Leader (FVL)
* As a Field Veterinary Coordinator (FVC)
* As a Food Business Operator (FBO)



###  Scoring

Scoring can be used to capture how people feel about the concepts in relation to the way things work now.
Score | Description
------- | -----
Worse | Not as good as the current application.
Same | About the same as good as the current application.
Better | Better than the current application

We can then work to:
- revisit and improve any functions that score a _Worse_ rating.
- ensure all functions deliver the _Same_ or better outcome as the current application.
- fine-tune functions with a _Better_ rating.
