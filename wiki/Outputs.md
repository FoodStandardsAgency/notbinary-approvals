## Reconstructing Approvals 
The [discovery outputs](#index-of-outputs) are building blocks and resources for the FSA to re-configure or transform Approvals delivery. 

They are intended to be used by the FSA to 
1. consciously design / reconstruct the vision for approvals in the context of the FSA service portfolio 
1. make better decisions about what shape and scale of solution is needed to deliver that vision 

The shape of any solution is not prescribed by this discovery. The prototypes and models that have been built during the Discovery are only suggested ways to reconstruct the service.  

## Modernising Approvals will need more than just a digital treatment
The key outputs support each other and are useful for testing possible service design scenarios: 
* [service proposal](service-proposal)  identifies **policy and mindset considerations** within the legal constraints
* [workflow models](service-timeline#workflows) highlight **operational opportunities** and requirements
* [story map](User-story-mapping) flags the **user needs** that the service has to meet, some of which only exist because of existing policy and operational constraints. 
* [user interface prototypes](#interaction--prototypes) suggest **accessible interaction approaches** to addressing those needs
* [data model](Data-and-API) demonstrates potential **technology architecture** considerations that underpin a modern digital treatment
