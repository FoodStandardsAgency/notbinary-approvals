There is a [clear legislative need](service-context#governance-overview) for the Approvals service. It is the first core and regulated service that the FSA provides to a meat plant food business operator. It is the point at which 
* _internally_: teams and departments can be aligned for pre-approval and in-life operations
* _externally_: the relationship between the FSA and the FBO changes (including starts, extends or ends)

The current policy and delivery approach is a missed strategic and operational opportunity to start building a clear view or audit trail of the FSA's experience with an FBO. 

Common threads currently hindering the service:

* **Fragmented** - multiple actors and systems are involved across department and silos, which requires a high coordination effort to avoid duplication and ensure consistent intelligence sharing and use
* **Fractured** - there is no clear single point of view for an approval
* **Isolated** - teams and tools are disconnected
* **Manual** - routine tasks take longer and error prone
* **Pressured** - actors are time-poor and time-consuming
* **Misvalued** - prioritise immediacy over the big picture

The discovery finds that in order to enable a more consistent and accessible user experience, along with reliable and timely tracking, the FSA can take steps to 
1. improve data capture
   - collect the _right data at the right time_
   - ensure it is _validated_ before it enters FSA data stores, to ensure reliable business decisions are made with it
   - make it _well structured_ to support better automation and heavy lifting by systems
2. improve data flow
   - increase _visibility_ for service actors for improved communication and reduced handoffs, along with associated processing delays and errors
   - to drive easier and more relevant _reporting_ of appropriate service metrics
   - enable better and more timely _secondary use_ of approvals data by other teams

The [workflow](Service-timeline-&-the-approvals-lifecycle) and [data](Data-and-API) models, along with the application form and case management [prototypes](Design-considerations) that have been worked up during Phase 2 of the discovery have begun to explore routes to deconstruct the existing mechanisms to enable a responsive [approvals service](service-proposal) that is supported by modern [technology](technology-overview).
