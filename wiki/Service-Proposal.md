## What does it mean to 'modernise' Approvals?

Food business operators are required by law to seek approval from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and/or other competent authority before commencing food production activities. An approval helps to define how and when they will be monitored and regulated as part of the effort to safeguard food safety and animal health in the UK. 

Where the FSA is the competent authority for an activity, the path to approval has evolved over time as the FSA has brought together earlier agencies and regulatory bodies. As with many organisations, processes, procedures and tools have been inherited, adapted, and revised over time, typically in a piece-meal way, in response to the needs at a particular time. 

This Service Proposal sets out a vision for updating the way Approvals are delivered. It describes how processes and procedures could be modernised in an appropriate way, applying technology at a level that is relevant to the work being done and the context in which it is completed. While the proposal focuses on the role digitisation can play, it does not assume technology or automation is the only answer and highlights where other structural elements, such as service design and operational policy, could help to drive improvements and efficiencies. 


## Re-imagining Approvals as a service
In the Service Lifecycle, we have demonstrated how "Approvals" is not simply a set of administrative tasks but part of a broader process that enables a Food Business Operator (FBO) to operate. We've seen that the process involves numerous teams, roles and individuals across the FSA and beyond. We have seen how the FBO is not just a 'customer' of the FSA but a key player in ensuring approvals can function as a way of delivering official controls.

We have shown that although it would be possible to ringfence those admin tasks, redesign procedures, and update the tools used, in practice these tasks do not function in isolation and that with a wider service lens it is possible to see how smaller incremental changes in one place can drive benefits up- and downstream.

By representing Approvals as a series of lifecycle stages, workflows and tasks we set up an environment where it becomes easier to deconstruct the way things work today; re-imagine how they could be done in future; and put them back together in ways that creates space for continuous improvement both externally in the FBO experience, and internally to the FSA ways of working. It makes it easier to decide the amount of digitisation and automation at a level that is appropriate and proportionate for the work being done.

Deconstructing the current process allows us to distinguish between workflows and tasks that are about managing requests, and those that are about administering approvals over time. This means we can start to apply an approach based on service management good practice as we re-imagine how approvals could work.

Deconstructing the current process also allows us to reveal more clearly where Approvals depends on human intervention, and where this needs to be preserved and ideally enhanced in any future service. At various points through the Approvals lifecycle, expertise is needed to support decision making with veterinary, legal, food standards and policy judgement and experience. We can hopefully start to pick out what data and information is needed at those points and make sure it is available, accessible, consistent, and usable.


### Service Proposal principles:
The Service Proposal uses the following working principles: 

* Digitisation where it is possible.
* Automation where it makes sense.
* Self-service where it is right.

These principles mean a future solution can be right-sized for the scope, scale and volumes of approvals work.

### Steering a shift in mindset
Any change in the way longstanding work gets done will need, or bring about, a shift in the way people view and understand how things work. To help steer that change, we can imagine a future Approvals service as moving the FSA:

* **From forms to enduring records and usable data** - Today, information that supports approvals is largely collected, created, and maintained using forms. These forms are essentially Microsoft Word documents. They may be available online but they are based on traditional data collection methods which were designed for paper records. We don't need to think like that now; we have technology and tools available that mean we can rethink how we collect, manage and share information and leverage the data it provides. <br> <br> An approval is something that an FBO needs throughout the period they are regulated by the FSA. The FSA uses approvals to deliver its legislative obligations and ensure enough of the right people are in the right place at the right time to protect food safety. It is a living set of information that must be accurate and up to date. Modern tools allow us to treat it like that in real, or near-real, time.

* **From data entry to information management** - Because information collection has been centred on form-filling, it has naturally lead to a need to transfer that information into various systems. As different systems or new business processes have been introduced the workload of collecting and entering information has increased and become more time-consuming. Whenever large amounts of information are being re-keyed manually the scope for error or misinterpretation expands and the time required for quality checking increases.<br><br>A future service can reduce or remove the need to re-enter data by enabling FBOs to provide information online and in formats that automate the creation of records. Information can then be moved to the right place and managed via tasks and actions either on demand or when scheduled.

* **From data capture to data driven** -  The focus today is on capturing information from FBOs at the start of their relationship with the FSA and repeatedly through the time they require an approval. That information is logged in multiple systems for use by different departments and teams in the FSA but it cannot be described as data that can be leveraged, at least not easily. Using the information being captured to identify regional or seasonal trends, or manage and deploy resources as effectively as possible is difficult and an entirely manual task of reviewing and extracting facts and figures.<br><br>A future service would be designed so that data could be more easily extracted without manual work and turned into productive reporting.

* **From admin to case management** - While there is a perception that approvals work is largely administrative, we have shown that this undermines the true picture. <br><br>The relationship between an FBO and the FSA can be recast in customer service terms, and the processes and procedures that manage and maintain approvals can be redefined as case management. This means that an ongoing history of engagement between FBOs and the FSA is built up over time and every interaction is logged against a durable and persistent record.

* **From admin to request management** - We know that FBOs submit approval application forms for a number of different reasons depending on whether they are a new or existing business operator, switching between activities that are regulated by the FSA or other competent authority, or making changes to an approval that is already in place. By taking a more customer service approach, we can differentiate between the reasons for contacting the FSA and design workflows that address specific request types and define the best way to fulfil them. This supports the idea of segmentation (services and processes tailored to FBO type and need) and enables self-service where it is appropriate. 

* **From dependency to collaboration and self-service** - There is little or no capacity for FBOs or other parts of the FSA to self-serve in finding and, where appropriate, maintaining approvals information. <br><br>By identifying workflows and individual tasks, we can pick out those tasks that could be candidates for self-service and reducing the heavy reliance on manual information distribution. Allowing people to self-serve does not mean open access to everything. By mapping out workflows and tasks to a more granular level we can identify where self-service is most relevant and design technology to enable people to support themselves with a 'just enough' approach. 

* **From performance targets to continuous improvement** - Current key performance indicators focus on time-based deadlines for completing particular tasks. In some cases, such as where an FBO adopts a seasonal pattern of operations, these indicators cannot be achieved for practical reasons and become irrelevant. The current silo-based nature of the approvals lifecycle makes it difficult to smooth over the break points in the process and track the success of approvals end-to-end. <br><br>By making the approval the centre of attention rather than the task in hand, we can start to reduce these silos, measure end-to-end process success, identify persistent break points, and address areas for improvement.


## Enabling change

To enable these transitions, we need to lay out some definitions and working assumptions. These are not necessarily new, but they become more critical if there is to be any attempt to digitise, automate, and/or leverage data from new ways of working.

First, the Service Proposal defines an Approval as:
* Being part of an ongoing relationship between a FBO and the FSA.
* Having four elements: a competent authority, an FBO, a premises, and one or more activities.
* Being made up of a collection of pieces of data and information about those elements that is maintained over time.

Second, the Service Proposal works on the assumption that:
* An **approval is not a one-off decision** or event but something that continues over a period of time, or lifecycle.
* An approval has a different status at various points in the lifecycle, and these statuses can refer to the FBO, the premises, and/or one or more activities. Typically, a status is 'Not yet approved', 'Approved', and 'No longer approved'.
* Moving an approval through the lifecycle is a mix of administrative tasks and decision-driven actions. Decisions require analysis of information available at a given moment and judgement based on business rules and expertise knowledge.
* The **lifecycle** of an approval is comprised of a number of **workflows**, more or less aligned with business processes.
* Work done to an approval is largely about creating and maintaining data and information, and communicating those changes to the right people at the right time.
* Work is completed through one or more '**jobs to be done**', or tasks. 
* **Tasks can be in different states**, typically 'Waiting to be done', 'Doing', and 'Done' although they may have more defined and descriptive labels depending on the task and audience.
* **Tasks can be assigned to a role and/or individual**. Individuals are allocated to roles.
* **Workflows and tasks are typically triggered by an event**, such as a request to create or change something. Completing one workflow or task may trigger another to start.


## Approvals re-imagined 
Re-imagining Approvals as a service means **adopting a service management approach** and **implementing customer service good practice**. This approach provides the framework for changing the perception of approvals from an administrative process to a case management system.

The concept **focuses on the continuing relationship between an FBO and the FSA**, and the use of the approval to manage and maintain that relationship.


This model is based on the idea that an approval is a data asset with attributes and a status. Attributes must always include a competent authority, an FBO, a premises, and one or more activity. **Imagining an approval in terms of data and attributes gives us the building blocks to create a digitised service**.

**Work is done whenever any one of the attributes is changed**. Each action is logged and timestamped against the approval so **an audit trail is created that provides a readily available record of the engagement between the FBO and the FSA**. 

This audit trail also provides **data that can be leveraged to monitor and manage FSA workloads, resources, performance and efficiencies**.

The future approvals service would be comprised of three key layers:

* **User enablement** - Tools that facilitate user-focussed interaction, capture information and knowledge, and trigger workflows and tasks.
* **Workflow enablement** - Work management tools and procedures that can initiate and track automated tasks and enhance manual work.
* **Information enablement** - Data modelling that structures the capture, storage and redistribution of information so that it supports automated tasks, enhanced manual work, and reporting.  

### User enablement
User enablement is delivered by:
* **User-focussed access points that lower the barriers to engage with the approvals process**.<br><br>For FBOs, this means the facility to supply the information required to gain approval and then to update that information as required by the process. The first step is to enable FBOs to apply for approval online via the food.gov website.
<br><br>For the Approvals Team, this means the facility to view information about an approval; assign, accept and perform work to create, manage and maintain an approval; and track work that is carried out on that approval by stakeholders across the FSA.<br><br>For other stakeholders in the approvals lifecycle, this means having the facility to view information about an approval that is relevant to their role; track work that is carried out on that approval; and interact with the process at specified points. For example, to be assigned a task and to confirm when that task has been completed.

### Workflow enablement
Workflow enablement is delivered by:
* **Workflow diagrams that break the end-to-end approvals lifecycle into a series of outcome-specific flows and show the available path(s) to completing approvals work**. These act as 'wiring diagrams' between the user/system interaction points and the data flow that underpins each transaction in the process.
* **A workflow engine that manages triggers and end points**, either automating actions or notifying the relevant stakeholder(s) to complete a task. Triggers can be automated and/or controlled manually as appropriate.

### Information enablement
Information enablement is delivered by:
* **Data modelling that define data types and states** that can be used to trigger and control workflows and tasks.
* **API models that facilitate the sharing and redistribution of data** from approvals to relevant systems at appropriate times.


## Service outcomes
Based on our user research, and analysis of the current interaction points, service design, and data structures, this Service Proposal seeks to address five key problems.

### Five targets
* **Remove the dependency on email**<br><br>Communication, submitting information, and sharing data is heavily dependent on email and manual intervention. Although some data transfer is in place between specific systems, the bulk of task and knowledge management relies on email and attachments.<br><br>By introducing a customer service style system and a case management approach, tasks and knowledge sharing is managed through a common platform with access determined by role and function. Approvals information may need to be stored in external repositories depending on the FSA's IT strategy and data policies, but it is managed, maintained and accessed from a common entry point. Communications and notifications are also connected to tasks and form part of a consistent audit trail, rather than Outlook (both shared and individual mailboxes) becoming a separate knowledge store in itself.

* **Change the dependency on notification**<br><br>The approvals lifecycle depends on subject matter experts in different parts of the FSA, including at different times the Finance, Audit and Field Ops Inspections teams. Within the core approvals process there is a blended effort of the Approvals Team, Field Veterinary Leads, Field Veterinary Coordinators, and the Approvals Panel. This relies on a constant stream of notifications and updates, often passed via the Approvals Team shared mailbox. Distribution lists can change frequently and are clunky to maintain. It is a known known that distribution of notifications and information can be inconsistent.<br><br>In the new way of working, a more defined workflow and set of task triggers makes it possible to clarify who needs to be notified at different points in a process, and to automate when and how that notification is sent. This could involve a blend of fully- and partially-automated actions. For example, an Appovals Team member closing a task may automatically send an update to another, pre-defined stakeholder. With an approvals system in place, there is opportunity for notifications to be made both within the system and via standard tools such as email or text.

* **Improve the status tracking of approvals**<br><br>There is no one system of record for approvals. Although the Single Information Repository (SIR) and Establishments & People (E&P) provide some degree of data centralisation, they do not deliver a single source of a truth and the connections between them and other systems are complex to maintain. It is a known known that an alternative solution will be required. In the meantime, approvals information is logged in a very dispersed way, typically in local documents and fileshares where it cannot be easily referenced.<br><br>'Knowing the FBO' and 'where things are today' means collating facts and figures from a range of tools and repositories. This lack of connected data makes it very difficult to have confidence in the information available and there is a dependency on the working relationship within the Approvals Team and wider stakeholders to pinpoint the status of an approval at any given time.<br><br> In the new way of working, data is made more available and usable as information is re-designed and re-organised so that it can be re-used and re-purposed.

* **Mitigate against breaks in the flow of tasks**<br><br>Progress through the approval lifecycle is very stop/start as work is passed between different teams and subject matter experts.The approval is the constant in the FBO/FSA relationship but sight of this is lost because the FBO is passed between departments and teams depending on what is happening on any given day.<br><br>In the new way of working, tasks are assigned and logged in a shared system. The information needed to complete tasks is connected to the 'job to be done' and made available in a consistent format. Silos are reduced or removed as approvals are managed and maintained with a collective responsibility but a single system of record that touches different parts of the FSA. 

* **Create space for value-added work**<br><br>The heavily manual and fragmented way that the approvals process is delivered leaves little scope to focus on the FBO user experience.<br><br>By automating tasks where appropriate, space is created to reinvent the support provided to FBOs. This could include in-screen/field-level guidance, live chat/text, and an expansion of the phone support currently available which has created a good reputation for the Approvals Team among the FBO community. The perceived value of the Approvals Team by FBOs should not be underestimated; there is a vital role to play as the first point of contact and the 'face of the FSA'.
