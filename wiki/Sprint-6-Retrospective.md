## Kudos

- Jag/Paul Murray for summarising the FBO research. Nice interpretation of what they've said so far given the limited availability of participants.
- The team for today's show & tell. Although we've all been working on separate things it all came together really nicely.
- Jag and Stephen, thanks for the input on the visuals, kept things on track and in the right direction.
- Jonno for the work so far on new user interfaces and the flow behind them. Really helping to identify the sections of workflows that could be changed.
- Jamie for some really clear diagrams explaining the data structures and flows. Especially given coming to this later than the rest of us!
- Jamie for good roundup of the data and tech considerations.
- Jag - Good find on the GDS management system case study
- Tracy Ostle for last minute access to quarterly meeting
- Stephen for the workflows, amazing overview of all work they do.

## Went well


- Meeting yesterday with FVLs and Approvals was very useful, putting the shared inbox back on the radar was an important discovery.

- Gatecrashing the quarterly FVL / Approvals team meeting - great to get input from FVLs, and new working contexts.

- Another positive S&T. Good turn attendance, engagement and reaction to work done so far.

- Miro for prototyping - Balsamiq is now behind a paywall! Miro has worked well instead of it.

- E&P and APMS walkthrough. Really started to appreciate the complexity behind publishing the approved establishments information.

- Miro (through gritted teeth) for drawing up the lifecycle. It does come into its own for larger scale diagramming. Follow up work is more challenging.

- FSA pattern library lends itself well to the components and patterns I want to incorporate.

- The outputs for the different workstreams are fitting together nicely.

- Finding the sweet spot between just enough and completion of outputs.

- Finally getting a sense of what data is where.  E&P has been really useful (even if some disagree)

  


## To improve

- Felt like notes and findings have been a bit all over the place. Starting the wireframes was a bit bogged down in going around my own information trying to figure out what's needed where.
- To follow that, I'd lost sight of the shared inbox and how key it is to this process.
- Taking time ahead to decide the best tools for creating assets. Lost time this week before ending up going ahead with Miro for the workflows.
- Exploring the tooling options for workflow design has been distracting and confusing.
- Manually coding up all the activities was slow and long, felt like a real time sink and put me on the back foot for the rest of the week. Either should have made a tool to automate this, or just done a few to illustrate.

## Action items

- [ ] Jonno: A lesson learned - having the user needs from personas is an invaluable tool when it comes to the prototyping.
- [ ] DM: using the right tools (eg, Github issues) for balancing visibility of workstream tasks across the team (to ensure alignment) with effort / overhead to manage
