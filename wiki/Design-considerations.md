# Design considerations
## Understanding design considerations
In the prototyping phase, we want to test hypoheses drawn from research completed in Discovery. As we design and iterate ideas, we need to take a range of business, process and technology constraints into account. These are not necessarily restrictions or blockers, but factors that must either be incorporated into the design or which help inform the direction we take.

The prototyping is a tool to test our understanding on the problem and understand how potential solutions could work to achieve this. That is, to understand the need and opportunities for 
- improving the flow and integration of approval application data
- facilitating better tracking of applications
- reducing manual overheads for managing the service
- meeting internal and external user needs through the application process

Prototypes have been evolved based around the following use cases: 
- [applying for an approval](Prototype-application-form)
- [managing an approval](Prototype-case-management-system)
