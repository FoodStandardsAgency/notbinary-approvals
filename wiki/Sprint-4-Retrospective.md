## Kudos

- Jag for pulling together the interim service assessment. Really seemed to have captured everybody's observations.
- Jag for your work on the service self assessment and phase 2 proposal presentation
- Paul Murray for the user story mapping. Appreciate it must have been difficult to keep track of my workflow mapping as it's been a moving target! The user stories are looking very comprehensive.
- Paul Murrary for turning round the FBO survey and getting us some wider feedback when it was looking like FBOs would be a worrying gap in our research.
- Paul McG for helping to keep focus on the Approvals Team and keeping other stakeholders in perspective. Easy to go off at a tangent with this one!
- The team for being open about any confusion at the start of the week and being constructive in getting a plan together.
- Jonno for finally accepting the future is K2  ðŸ˜„
- Jag, for pitching the mid-stage update at an appropriate level to give John Lawrence everything he needed to understand what has happened to date and proposed next steps. Also fielded all the questions well and ultimately got John's buy-in.
- Jonno for picking up the UR and application gaps
- Jamie for helping to bring some structure to some of the sessions and approach.
- Jonno for calling out where team process might need a different approach.

## Went well


- Ruby Tuesday. The V-shape bounce back! We came back with a plan and got a good sense of what we need to do to move from Phase 1 to 2.
- Phase 2 planning. Quickly set out our high level objectives and it's good to have a clear view of what needs to be done over the next four weeks.
- Plan of action! Feels like we're well placed to begin phase 2.
- Phase 2 planning was helpful for surfacing some if the workstream inter-dependencies, which are going to be important to make work for us rather than hold us back in the next phase.
- Having some clear time this week to concentrate on the service lifecycle. Needed that space to unpick all the pieces and put them back together.
- Service assessment feedback and buy-in was excellent. Valuable to test and seed some of the potentially more radical recommendations and bring stakeholders along.
- Positive response from SRO (Dep) to mid-stage update and proposed next steps
- Better idea of technical output needed + some direction and previous examples to go on from carbs now
- Good interaction and response from S&T Stakeholders. Good alignment and consensus for Phase 2 all round.
- Another successful show & tell - good numbers attending and engagement
- Really handy to be able to reuse the lifecycle slide fom last week. Some other assets from this and previous discoveries are probably out there that can be re-purposed and give continuity.


## To improve

- I Don't Like Mondays. Not our finest hour and lacking in our usual coordination.
- False start with story mapping session.
- Bit more structure going into team sessions.
- Bumpy start with Github issues, and will take some time to adapt, but hopefully a useful option for us going forward, particularly in how we use it so support standups and sprint planning,
- Although the service assessment went well, I'm not convinced it is the right tool for the job at this stage. Seems more appropriate as a final wrap-up activity than a half-way review. Probably up for debate.
- I can't stand the rain
- Still need to make expected outputs a bit more defined for prototypes/tech output
- FBO research contingency is in play, but will need careful nudging / monitoring.
- New starter briefing / onboarding

## Action items

- [ ] Stephen: Stop it raining behind me when I'm on calls. It's not a good backdrop.
- [ ] Stephen: Check out alternative workflow mapping tools for the To Be diagrams in Phase 2.
- [ ] All: split out high-level Github issues into discrete deliverables / tasks / dependencies
- [ ] JG: check value of interim service assessment with PT
- [ ] Jonno: Crack on!
