## 29 June - 3 July 2020

[![Sprint # Retrospective board](uploads/retro/retro-3.png)](uploads/retro/retro-3.png)

## Kudos

- Jonno - building the prototype - much easier to have discussions once you have something concrete
- Paul Turner for giving a good context to development and such.
- Hannah Barker & Kev Maher - very supportive of the FBO wrangling effort
- Jonno's form prototype looked and worked well. Clearly got people thinking about what could be!
- Jonno. Prototype looks good and was well received at show & tell
- Paul Murray for putting together the questionnaire

## Went well


- Demo went down really well - great to be able to Show as well as Tell
- Well attended show and tell. Good engagement and positive reaction to work done so far.
- Useful extra context around register a food business and similar areas of work.
- Update on Ops Transformation and alignment with our work. Good to know OTP is not too far ahead and that our work will provide input they need.
- Regular short research update sessions over last couple of weeks are paying dividends - narrative around themes and opportunities is taking shape
- Building prototype relatively smooth.


## To improve

- Making clear the difference between prototype and production applications
- The FSA design question.  Suspect there is a list of design/technical/architectural things that will be expected that we need to discover
- Links to data team. Understanding what they are doing and helping them understand approvals.
- Positioning what we know/don't know from FBOs if we're unable to reach enough of them.
- Risk that assumptions and speculations can be taken as fact in S&T.
- Intense weeks - drying up by the time it gets to retro
- Quickly identifying other lines of work that we don't need to investigate further...just have on our radar. Lots of potential rabbit holes here.
- FBO contingency arrangements have taken away from delivery time

## Action items

- [ ] DM: requirements to take into production
- [ ] DM: pick up with Carbs re FSA system and security / requirements.
- Jonno: All team, don't beat ourselves up!
