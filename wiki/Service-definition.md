### Approvals and the Food Standards Agency

As part of the measures to safeguard food safety and animal health in the UK, Food Business Operators (FBOs) must seek approval from the relevant Competent Authority prior to commencing specified food production activities. An approval determines how and when the FBO will be monitored and regulated through their operational life. The Competent Authority responsible is determined by the activity being undertaken and the circumstances of the individual FBO. In the UK, an FBO needs to be granted approval from either the FSA and/or their local authority (England and Wales) or district council (Northern Ireland).

Food Standards Scotland is the competent authority in Scotland, although the FSA is responsible for maintaining and publishing UK-wide approvals information.

Approvals are granted based on the information provided by FBOs regarding the activities they wish to carry out and their operational readiness, and a series of announced and unannounced assessment visits and recommendations by field veterinary experts. Where the field veterinary lead is satisfied that the FBO meets initial requirements, a status of Conditional Approval can be granted. An FBO must be assessed once they are are operating before they can be granted Full Approval. Full Approval must be granted within six months of the initial conditional approval.

The approval is a living record; it must be maintained so it is current and accurately reflects the activities the FBO wishes to carry out. There is a burden of responsibility on both the FBO to provide current and accurate information about their operations, and on the FSA to grant and report approval for regulated activities.

Changing an approval can be driven by an FBO request or be based on the outcome of an FSA audit inspection. An approval may be placed under review where an FBO is non-compliant with the regulations or seen to be operating outside the activities for which is is approved.

An Advisory Visit can be requested whereby the FSA provides pre-approval guidance to an FBO as a paid-for (Â£340) service. This does not guarantee approval or fast-track the process, and does not replace the system of assessment visits.

An approval can be:
* Surrendered by the FBO when they close operations or no longer carry out activities that require FSA approval.
* Suspended by the FSA when audit or other inspections identify deficiencies in the FBO's operations and the FBO is implementing a plan of remedial action.
* Withdrawn by the FSA when it is evident that the FBO will not or cannot reach the required levels of compliance.

## Mission
Approvals is the service where the FSA 'gets to know the FBO'. Information collected through approvals underpins all of the other services by which the FSA delivers the Official Controls to safeguard food safety in the UK. It helps determine what activities need to be inspected, tested, sampled, and audited and the resources required to do so; knowing what activities are approved and under what circumstances helps determine which regulations are in force, when compliance breaches occur, and how enforcement can be applied. 

Having an accurate picture of the FBO also ensures that the FSA can recoup the costs of inspection and that services are invoiced accurately and timely.

With this in mind, it is critical that the FSA has an up to date understanding of the FBO's operations. This has historically been managed via form-based information sharing and data capture in various systems but this approach is increasingly labour-intensive and at odds with a broader move within the FSA towards digital services.

## Vision and goals
### Visualising success
A successful approvals service means that:

* An FBO can submit information about their business and intended operation to the FSA.
* An FBO can update information about their business and/or operations to the FSA.
* An FBO can quickly ascertain their approval status.
<br><br>
* The Approvals Team can capture information from FBOs.
* The Approvals Team can log requests and actions performed against an approval.
* The Approvals Team can notify relevant stakeholders, inside and outside the FSA, regarding work on approvals.
<br><br>
* Field Veterinary experts can reference and act upon approvals information.
* Field Veterinary experts can contribute to the information that enables the FSA to 'know the FBO' and apply the right regulation at the right time.
<br><br>
* The Approvals Panel can reference and act upon approvals information and either uphold or challenge Field Veterinary recommendations.
<br><br>
* FSA teams and individuals who contribute to the approvals lifecycle, particularly in Finance and the Audit teams, can review approvals information and collaborate on tasks.
<br><br>
* The FSA can leverage approvals information to meet its regulatory and reporting obligations.

### Measuring goals
Current key performance indicators are primarily focussed on:
* An overall objective to deliver full approval within six months of conditional approval being granted.<br><br>While this target is generally achieved, the lack of segmentation (recognising variations in the sector) means that KPIs are immediately undermined in . A key example is the approval of seasonal operating patterns which cannot, for operational purposes, be completed within the six month timeframe.
* Deadlines designed to time-box the completion specific assessment visit related tasks, such as responding to an initial FBO enquiry within 10 days and quality checking FVL assessment reports within five days. Anecdotal evidence from user research suggests FBOs are happy with the turnaround time for reports and recommendations.

Charging for advisory visits was introduced in April 2019 to reduce the number of FBOs using the visits as a form of free consultancy that consume significant amounts of FSA expert time. Numbers of visits roughly halved (21 visits logged between July 2019 and February 2020) in the year after charging was introduced albeit from a relatively low base. Ensuring FBO readiness to apply for approval appears to be an ongoing issue.

There are no apparent strategic targets around minimising an FBO's "time to operations", even taking into an account that in most cases an FBO must be granted conditional approval and be assessed once operating before full approval is granted. Anecdotal evidence from user research suggests that while the gaps between assessment visits was seen as practical and providing time for FBOs to respond and act, the overall process could seem relentless and designed to find reasons to reject rather than enable compliance. There is potentially a disconnect between the administrative and the assessment approach to approvals.

The [Success Criteria & Service Constraints](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-approvals/wiki/success-criteria-and-service-constraints) section provides an overview of specific outcomes, and these are also captured against each 'job to be done' in the [Service Blueprint](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-approvals/wiki/service-blueprint).

## Service Components 
The key service components explored in this discovery are:
* The way FBOs provide the information needed to apply for approval.
* The way the Approvals Team receives and captures application for approval information.
* The way the Approvals Team initiates and logs the tasks to manage and maintain approvals.
* The way the stakeholders in the approvals process interact, share information, and collaborate on tasks that impact approvals.
* The way the FSA defines, stores, and leverages data relating to approvals.
