## User Needs
User needs are expressed in the following format: 

* As a… [which type of user has this need?]
* I need/want/expect to… [what does the user want to do?]
* So that… [why does the user want to do this?]

And optionally:
* When… [what triggers the user’s need?]
* Because… [is the user constrained by any circumstances?]

They aim to illustrate the underlying goals of the persona, with illustrative, as opposed to prescriptive solutions, since the same need might be met in a variety of ways.
