## Context 

The FSA is a national Competent Authority with a remit for food safety. Within this domain, the FSA has statutory obligations towards public health and animal welfare, including the approval of meat plant establishments at which controlled food chain activities are to be undertaken. 

The service to **approve establishments** is run as a primarily manual service. Tools used are disconnected from underlying registers and related operational systems. Resulting business processes are inefficient, and the service is correspondingly more cumbersome to track and manage. As it is currently applied, the approvals service does not meet internal user needs, or allow data to flow usefully and smoothly. 

## Goals

The discovery is looking to understand the needs and opportunities for 
- improving the **flow and integration** of approval application data
- facilitating better **tracking** of applications
- reducing manual **overheads** for managing the service
- meeting **internal and external user needs** through the application process 

This will support the design and development of prototypes for digitally enabling the approvals service, including ensuring compliance with accessibility and official controls legislation.

## Scope 

The discovery will examine the FSA's approvals process for meat plants in England & Wales only. 

Over the course of the discovery period we will examine
* user interactions with the approvals service
* data captured, communicated, shared and used through the process
* how existing systems and tools support the current service
* regulatory requirements that the service needs to meet
* accessibility and other prototyping considerations

Research findings from the first phase of the discovery will be used to identify opportunities for potential improvements to the approvals service tooling and processes.  The second phase of the discovery will be used to test these ideas through select prototypes.
