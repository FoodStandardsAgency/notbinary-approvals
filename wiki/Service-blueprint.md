## Understand the service blueprint

Business analysts and service designers take all the things that are needed to make a service work (such as people, processes, technology) and put them in context. The service blueprint is a way of collating and summarising that information in a single page.

The service blueprint provides a view of the end-to-end service, the task-level 'jobs to be done', and the touchpoints with people, governance, tools, and related metrics.

For this discovery/prototyping project, there are two service blueprints:
* An 'As Is' blueprint describing Approvals as they operate in July 2020.
* A 'To Be' blueprint depicting where touchpoints could change in relation to the Service Proposal and the prototypes created as part of this discovery.

Touchpoints on the blueprint contain a marker and/or brief statement which should act as triggers for anyone involved in designing or running the service.

The blueprint addresses a service-level view; the user-level experience is addressed elsewhere in [user segments](user-segments), [personas](personas), and [user story map](user-story-mapping).

## Service lifecycle, stages, and 'jobs to be done'

Each row in the blueprint represents a stage or activity in the service lifecycle. Each stage is broken down to show the **'jobs to be done'**, the activities that make up how **Approvals** are delivered as part of a much longer sequence of **'from the farm to the fork'** activities.

This gives us a sense of the tasks involved in delivering an end-to-end service, and shows that Approvals is neither a standalone, one-off piece of work nor a purely administrative task.

Based on research and analysis in [<discovery timeframe>](timeline-and-ceremonies), the blueprint has been designed around the following stages in the approval by the FSA journey:

* Before FSA approval
* Conditional approval
* Extended conditional approval
* Full approval
* Approval under review
* No longer approved


**Note.** Activities that relate to operating the service are also included as 'jobs to be done'. These tend to run in parallel to the main service delivery. They are often the things that 'just happen' and which can be easy to dismiss as being separate from approvals.

## Enabling components
Each column in the blueprint shows an enabling component, such as the user/stakeholder, governance, and the information and/or technology being used. It also shows any metrics and the constraints that should be taken into account when designing and operating the service.

This means we can cross-reference factors across the lifecycle of the service and keep the bigger picture in mind. It means we can identify priorities and ensure the right people are involved in the right way and at the right time.

The service blueprint allows us to focus on improving each job to be done with an awareness of all the corresponding touchpoints; or we can focus on a particular component such as a piece of technology and review which jobs to be done it impacts. We can minimise the risk of fixing things in isolation.
