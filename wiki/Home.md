This wiki documents research and [recommendations](recommendations) for the [Approval of Meat Plants service](definition). 

Findings are based on a [discovery](methodology) project carried out by [Notbinary](team) between [June and August 2020](timeline-and-ceremonies). 

The discovery [goal](scope) is to more fully understand the needs and opportunities for 
- improving the flow and integration of approval application data
- facilitating better tracking of applications
- reducing manual overheads for managing the service
- meeting internal and external user needs through the application process 

This will support the design and development of prototypes for digitally enabling the approvals service, including ensuring compliance with accessibility and official controls legislation.
