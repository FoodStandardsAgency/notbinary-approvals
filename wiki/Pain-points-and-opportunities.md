## Key pain points identified 

Approvals service users fall into three main categories:
* Food Business Operators prepare and submit applications (subject)
* Approvals Team Officers manage and coordinate requests (owner)
* Field Veterinary Leaders assess establishments (contributor)

### Subject - Food Business Operator (FBO)
* Better general guidance in the application form
* Better signposting to specific guidance, eg the Meat Inspectors Guide
* Can get confusing with all the different 'government' people turning up at different times (local authority etc)
* It's not always clear which establishment type is correct
* Need better guidance on what and how to change after inspection recommendations

### Owner - FSA Approvals team 
* No single source of truth 
* Approvals log 
* Template generation and maintenance 
* Administration complexity
* Keying the same data into multiple systems

### Contributor - Field Veterinary Leader (FVL) 
* Inspection forms are long and a lot is not relevant - needs to be streamlined
* Photo handling/uploading 
* Photo report 
* Advisory visit 

### Other users

Other internal users are involved and have different service responsibilities and goals, including: 
* FVC - carry out approvals inspection visits 
* Approvals panel - rejecting approvals 
* Audit - instigating approval reviews 
* Finance - invoicing businesses
