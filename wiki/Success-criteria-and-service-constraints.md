## Understand success criteria and service constraints

Success criteria are the outcomes of a process or task that enable a 'job to be done', and that meets the stakeholder's expectations and objectives.

Service constraints are factors that should be taken into consideration when designing, operating and improving the Approvals service.

Constraints are not necessarily roadblocks or reasons not to do things; they provide a way to recognise concerns, potential clashes of interest, technical and process-related issues, and other factors that could prevent the service from being fully successful.

They enable a service team to either find ways to remove or reduce the constraint, or build an acceptance that there will be limitations to what the service can achieve.

Constraints could be:
* **Known knowns** - Things we know will have an impact and can clearly define.
* **Known unknowns** - Things we know will have an impact but can't clearly define at the moment.



## Success criteria and service constraints for the Approvals service.
This section provides a high level summary of constraints that impact the approvals lifecycle. A full mapping of success criteria and constraints against individual jobs to be done is provided in the [Service Blueprint](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-approvals/wiki/service-blueprint).
