## Operational context

### Approvals in the FSA service value chain
As defined within the Operations Transformation Programme, there are five key areas of activity in the FSA's service value chain. Approvals is the first of these.
* Approvals
* Inspections
* Sampling & Testing
* Audit
* Enforcement

Approvals is the service where the FSA 'gets to know the FBO'. Information collected through approvals underpins all of the other services. It helps determine what activities need to be inspected, tested, sampled, and audited and the resources required to do so; knowing what activities are approved and under what circumstances helps determine which regulations are in force, when compliance breaches occur, and how enforcement can be applied.


### Operational structure:
**Customer base**
* 169-197 x FBOs submitting applications for approvals per year between 2016-19.

**Note.** This comprises: 40% applications for new approvals; 46% applications for additional activities; and 13% for re-approvals.


**Fulfilment**

Ownership of the approvals process rests within Regulatory Delivery and Operational Transformation (RDOT). In practice, approvals are delivered by a blended team of approvals administrators and field veterinary staff from RDOT and Field Operations. Work is organised on a regional basis with the team being allocated to an area and the clusters of FBOs within them. There can be considerable variation across the country in terms of number and type of FBO due to local traditions and conditions.

* 6 x Approvals Team administrators (RDOT)
* 9 x Field Veterinary Leads (Field Ops)
* 18 x Field Veterinary Coordinators (Field Ops)

**Note.** Field Ops staff are not dedicated to approvals work and have other responsibilities to deliver inspections which may take precedence.

**Approvals Decision Making Panel**

The Approvals Panel is convened to handle contentious cases. It brings together senior civil service, legal, veterinary and approvals team expertise to review FVL recommendations and advise on more complex or contentious decisions. The terms of reference for the panel lists its core membership as:
* Head of Operations Assurance Division or Head of Field Operations Legal (excluding the Director of Regulatory and Legal Strategy)
* Director of Wales (where applicable)
* Approvals Manager (minutes) or other representative from Approvals and Registration Team
* The Field Veterinary Leader making the recommendation
* Operations Head Veterinarian

**Dependencies**

The approvals lifecycle cannot be completed without the involvement of:
* Revenue & Accounting Team
* Audit Team (RDOT)
* Field Inspection Team (Field Ops)

**Note.** The scope of this discovery extends to meat plant approvals. It is recognised that there is a wider scope of other sectors and further authorisations, and that future service and product initiatives could leverage the output from here.

## Governance overview

Approvals are a requirement of the legislation governing food safety, animal health, and traceability. Governance is multi-layered, starting with EU and UK domestic regulations and accompanied by FSA operational policy and guidance.

The key pieces of legislation that govern approvals are:

### Regulations for FBOs

* Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002 Food Law
* Regulation (EC) No. 852/2004 General rules on hygiene
* Regulation (EC) No. 853/2004 Specific hygiene rules for products of animal origin

### Regulations for the Competent Authority

* Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002 Food Law
* Regulation (EC) No.882/2004 General rules for official controls
* Regulations (EC) No. 854/2004 Specific rules for official controls on products of animal origin

### Governance constraints
* As a government agency, the FSA is required to meet forthcoming guidelines governing accessibility of its public platforms and tools. Any future approvals solution must comply with [The Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/contents/made) which comes into force in September 2020.
