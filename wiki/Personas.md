* I need all the documentation to be easily available so that I am prepared for inspecting the FBO

**Pain Points**

* Time poor and I have other competing priorities on my time
* We can be viewed as just another 'government inspector' and this can make our role challenging. It looks like we are not joined up
* Managing photos and completing the Photo Evidence Report can be very time consuming - sometimes One Drive does not work and I have to email photos to myself
* The inspection report can be unwieldily and much of it is often not relevant
* Advisory visits are an additional responsibility 
* FBOs are not always ready to be inspected and it is waste of our time when they haven't even finished building 
* FBOs will sometimes not allow mobile devices on site, this makes our job more difficult
* FBOs can be hard to get hold of, making arranging inspections more time consuming that it needs to be
