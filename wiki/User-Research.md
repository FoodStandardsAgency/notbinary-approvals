### Research methods 

We conducted interviews with a subject matter experts from within the FSA and we contacted 30 FBOs with the intention of 1-on-1 remote interviews. We also identified additional users who can be classed as either collaborators with the Approvals team or consumers of their outputs, such as Field Veterinary Coordinators, Finance and Audit. 

We arranged a total of seven interviews with FBOs, however all but three either cancelled last minute or forgot to turn up. 

* 23 FSA subject matter experts
* 3/7 FBO interviews 
* 11/30 survey responses

The [user segments are described here](User-segments). 

### Method

The method was in-depth 1-on-1 remote interviews.

However, due to challenges in finding time with FBOs we also used a [Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdA6B6_YjideUHajJKFE-vROO30lS0tV8XTAG6Xg-4M_DK0Hg/viewform?usp=sf_link).

## About Personas 

Personas are behavioural archetypes that illustrate fictional individuals from key user segments. They are evidence driven, combining insights from across all research participants within a segment and are not a representation of any one individual.

Design Personas capture

* Personal profile, role, attitudes and behaviours
* Tools, skills and context of use
* Tasks, motivations and goals
* Key pain points and barriers with the task, tool or service

Personas are intended as a design tool and reference point, to support and inform a user-centric approach to solving key service challenges. By keeping the attributes of different audience groups visible and front of mind, the design and service team can ensure they remain focused on end user realities and goals. They inform and support reflective critique of work in progress (designs or builds).

They should evolve as the project progresses and more is learned about each one and further sub-personas may emerge.
