## Kudos

- Jag for bringing me back on track earlier this week.
- Stephen for excellent work with the lifecycle and walk-through for the team.
- Paul Murray for excellent work with the personas.
- Stephen & Paul for lifecycle and story mapping reviews. Great progress.
- Stephen and Paul for their work on the lifecycle / user stories presented in Wednesday's meeting
- Paul Murray for managing to get the user stories together while I kept making changes to the lifecycle.  ðŸ‘Œ
- Paul McGuinness for the talk through of establishment types
- Jonno for the form flow design. Good to see it in that format to help visualise the sequence.
- Paul McG for correcting user story mistakes and clarifying the 'why'
- Paul McG for being on hand for approvals log usage DFQs.
- Everyone for dumping this morning's workstream update...good that we can call out things we've already done!

## Went well


- Service lifecycle walkthrough - thanks for sitting through a lot of talking and scrolling around in Miro!
- Miro in general - feels like it's found it's place as an important tool for the team.
- All three walkthroughs went well
- Useful to catch prototypes WIP.
- Approvals Log usage review has been really helpful to see how artefacts are being used, and where the cruff is, rather than just taking a static view.
- Glad the service lifecycle and user mapping came together and complemented each other.
- K2 team conversation was helpful to confirm boundaries and expectations.


## To improve

- Stop, think and plan. Don't jump straight in.
- S&Ts - more show, less tell.
- More FBOs!
- Not sure we're adjusting to Github issues. Old habits / new habits.
- Balancing tech workstream across projects
- Being careful we don't allow scope creep around evaluating K2. We just need to deliver our prototypes.

## Action items

- Make time for co-developing (especially service / user story) assets or working in close parallel 
- Schedule mid-point asset review and walkthrough at similar stage
