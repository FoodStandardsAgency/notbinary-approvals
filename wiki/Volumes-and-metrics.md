### Headline points:
* Extracting service volumes and metrics relies on manual intervention and analysis. There is no quick reporting.
* Different stakeholder groups appear to report on different time periods.
* Service volumes appear relatively low but case numbers hide the level of complexity which is determined by type and scale of the FBO and the activities they want to undertake.
* There is no segmentation of FBOs, meaning there is no comparison of the experience of FBOs in terms of size and complexity of operation.
* Each application for approval can take up to six months to progress to full approval. 
* Service volumes do not capture the time spent by FBOs pre-application. The total "time to operation" is not captured.
